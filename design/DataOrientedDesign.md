To optimize the `Object` class for GPU ray tracing using a data-oriented design and a compact representation, you would want to minimize irregular memory access patterns and control flow divergence. Here’s how you might approach redesigning the class:

### Separate Arrays for Object Types

Instead of using a union within a single array, maintain separate arrays for each object type:

- `Sphere *spheres;`
- `Plane *planes;`
- `Triangle *triangles;`
- etc.

Each array holds only the data necessary for its type, ensuring that when you iterate over the array, all memory accesses are to the same type of object, which is more efficient for the GPU.

### SoA (Structure of Arrays) for Object Data

Within each type-specific array, use a structure of arrays rather than an array of structures to store object properties. For instance, for spheres:

```c
struct Spheres {
    float3 *centers;
    float *radii;
    int *materialIndices;
    // ... other sphere-specific properties
};
```

This layout ensures that when you process one property (like all centers), you are accessing contiguous memory, which is optimal for GPUs.

### Compact Intersection Methods

For the intersection methods, instead of a method within the `Object` structure, consider having type-specific intersection functions:

- `bool intersectSphere(const Ray &ray, const Sphere &sphere, HitInfo &hitInfo);`
- `bool intersectPlane(const Ray &ray, const Plane &plane, HitInfo &hitInfo);`
- etc.

This separates the logic from the data and allows for more efficient inlining and optimization by the compiler.

### Minimal Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH)

Implement a BVH that organizes the objects spatially. The BVH should be built using data-oriented principles, where the hierarchy is represented in a way that is efficient for traversal on the GPU.

### Data Structure for GPU Execution

Incorporate data structures that are tailored for GPU execution. For instance, instead of relying on dynamic polymorphism (which is not efficient on GPUs), use index-based approaches where you have an array of indices for each object type, and a corresponding array of intersection functions.

### Example Redesign

Here’s a sketch of what the redesigned class and data structures might look like:

```c
struct SphereData {
    float3 *centers;
    float *radii;
    // ... other properties
};

struct PlaneData {
    float3 *points;
    float3 *normals;
    // ... other properties
};

struct TriangleData {
    float3 *vertices;
    // ... other properties
};

struct Scene {
    SphereData spheres;
    PlaneData planes;
    TriangleData triangles;
    // BVH structures
    // ... other scene data
};

// Intersection functions
__device__ bool intersectRayWithSphere(const Ray &ray, const SphereData &spheres, int index, HitInfo &hitInfo);
__device__ bool intersectRayWithPlane(const Ray &ray, const PlaneData &planes, int index, HitInfo &hitInfo);
// ... other intersection functions

// Kernel that performs ray tracing
__global__ void rayTraceKernel(const Scene scene, /* other params */) {
    // Calculate thread-specific ray
    Ray ray = calculateRay(/* params */);

    // Perform intersection tests with the scene objects
    for (int i = 0; i < scene.spheres.count; ++i) {
        if (intersectRayWithSphere(ray, scene.spheres, i, hitInfo)) {
            // handle intersection
        }
    }
    // ... handle other object types
}
```

The `Scene` struct holds all the data for the scene, and `rayTraceKernel` is a CUDA kernel that performs the ray tracing. Note that in this design, the intersection functions are separate and can be optimized independently for each object type. The BVH would also be part of the `Scene` structure but is not detailed here.

This design maximizes memory coalescence and minimizes control flow divergence, leading to better GPU performance. However, it's essential to profile and test these changes, as the optimal structure can depend on the specific use case and GPU architecture.
