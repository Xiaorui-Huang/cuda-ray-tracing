For ray tracing an image of width \( W \) and height \( H \), the CUDA kernel
launch parameters (enclosed within `<<< >>>`) determine how many blocks and
threads are used to execute the kernel. These parameters are crucial for the
efficient use of GPU resources.

The kernel launch configuration typically looks like this:

```c
dim3 blocks( ... ); // The grid dimension
dim3 threadsPerBlock( ... ); // The block dimension
rayTraceKernel<<<blocks, threadsPerBlock>>>(...); // Kernel launch
```

### 1D vs 2D Threads

Both 1D and 2D thread organizations can be used for ray tracing tasks. The
choice between them often depends on the preference and the specific hardware
being used.

- **1D Threads**: With 1D threads, you linearize the 2D space of the image. Each
  thread computes the ray for one pixel. The index calculation is typically done
  by using the thread's unique ID and the width of the image:

    ```c
    int idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    int x = idx % W;
    int y = idx / W;
    if (x < W && y < H) {
        // Calculate the ray for the pixel at (x, y)
    }
    ```

- **2D Threads**: With 2D threads, you directly map the 2D space of the image to
  2D blocks and threads. Each thread still computes one pixel, but the index
  calculations are more intuitive:

    ```c
    int x = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    int y = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;
    if (x < W && y < H) {
        // Calculate the ray for the pixel at (x, y)
    }
    ```

### Calculating Blocks and Threads

For the kernel launch parameters, you need to decide the size of the grid
(number of blocks) and the size of each block (number of threads per block).
Here's how you might calculate them:

- **2D Grid Configuration**:

    ```c
    dim3 threadsPerBlock(16, 16); // 16x16 threads per block is a common choice
    dim3 numBlocks(ceil(W / float(threadsPerBlock.x)), ceil(H / float(threadsPerBlock.y)));
    rayTraceKernel<<<numBlocks, threadsPerBlock>>>(...);
    ```

    In this configuration, each thread block is responsible for a 16x16 pixel
    section of the image. The `numBlocks` ensures that there are enough blocks
    to cover the entire image.

- **1D Grid Configuration**:

    ```c
    int threadsPerBlock = 256; // 256 threads per block is a common choice for 1D
    int numBlocks = ceil(W * H / float(threadsPerBlock));
    rayTraceKernel<<<numBlocks, threadsPerBlock>>>(...);
    ```

    Here, you linearize the 2D image into a 1D array of pixels and launch enough blocks to cover all pixels.

### In Practice

The choice between 1D and 2D threads can depend on the specifics of the workload
and the GPU's architecture. 2D threads can be more intuitive for image
processing tasks, as they map naturally to the 2D nature of an image. However,
if you're dealing with very large images or if the access patterns to the image
    data are not strictly 2D, a 1D layout might be more efficient.

Regardless of the dimensionality of the threads, it's important to ensure that:

- Each thread processes only one pixel, or a small, manageable chunk of pixels.
- The total number of threads launched does not exceed the image size (i.e., check bounds within the kernel).
- The number of threads per block is a multiple of the warp size (32 on NVIDIA GPUs) to avoid partial warps and ensure efficient execution.

Always profile your kernel with different configurations to find the optimal
setup for your specific application and hardware. CUDA profilers can help you
understand the performance characteristics and guide your tuning process.
