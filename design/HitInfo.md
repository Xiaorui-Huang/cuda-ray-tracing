`HitInfo` is a structure designed to capture detailed information about the interaction between a ray and an object in a scene, particularly in the context of ray tracing. When a ray intersects with an object, `HitInfo` is used to record various intersection details that are essential for rendering the scene accurately, such as:

- `tNear`: The distance along the ray from its origin to the nearest intersection point with an object.
- `tFar`: The distance to the farthest intersection point along the same ray, which can be useful for rendering transparent materials or volumetric effects.
- `normal`: The normal vector of the surface at the intersection point, which is critical for shading calculations to determine how light interacts with the surface.
- `objectId`: An identifier for the object that was hit. This is typically used to look up object-specific data that might be required for shading or additional processing.
- Additional properties: These might include texture coordinates for texture mapping, or any other data relevant to rendering or physics calculations.

The updated `HitInfo` struct with constructor could look like this:

```cpp
struct HitInfo {
    float tNear;    // Distance from the ray origin to the nearest intersection
    float tFar;     // Distance from the ray origin to the farthest intersection
    Vec3 normal;    // Normal at the intersection
    int objectId;   // Object identifier

    // Constructor to initialize with maximum distance (infinity) and invalid object ID
    __device__ HitInfo() : tNear(FLT_MAX), tFar(FLT_MAX), objectId(-1) {
        // Normal vector is implicitly initialized (could be zero-initialized or default-constructed depending on Vec3)
    }

    // Additional properties and functions related to hit information can be added here
};
```

In a ray tracing application, the `HitInfo` structure is passed by reference to intersection methods to be populated with data in case of an intersection. An intersection function using `HitInfo` might be implemented as follows:

```cpp
__device__ bool intersectAABB(const Ray &ray, const AABB &box, HitInfo &hitInfo) {
    // Implementation of AABB-ray intersection algorithm.
    // This method updates the hitInfo parameter with intersection details if an intersection occurs.
    // The implementation will calculate tNear and tFar, update the normal and objectId fields as necessary,
    // and return true if an intersection is found, false otherwise.
}
```

When the intersection function is called, it checks whether the ray intersects the object, and if it does, it updates `hitInfo` with the relevant intersection information. If an intersection occurs closer than any previously recorded intersections, the `HitInfo` structure is updated accordingly, thereby always keeping the closest intersection details.

Here is an example of how the `HitInfo` might be used within a larger ray tracing kernel:

```cpp
__global__ void traceRays(const Ray *rays, const Object *objects, int numObjects, HitInfo *hitInfos) {
    int idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x; // Compute the global thread ID
    HitInfo hitInfo; // Initialize hit information for the current ray
    bool hit = false; // Flag to check if an intersection occurred

    for (int i = 0; i < numObjects; ++i) {
        if (intersectAABB(rays[idx], objects[i].aabb, hitInfo)) {
            // The intersectAABB function would update hitInfo with the intersection details
            hit = true;
            // Break out of the loop if the closest possible intersection is found
            // Depending on the rendering technique, you might continue checking for intersections (e.g., for transparency)
        }
    }

    if (hit) {
        hitInfos[idx] = hitInfo; // Store the hit information for this ray
    } else {
        hitInfos[idx] = HitInfo(); // Store default hit information indicating no intersection
    }
}
```

This kernel illustrates how multiple rays can be traced in parallel across a scene composed of various objects. Each thread computes intersections for a single ray and stores the closest intersection details in a corresponding `HitInfo` instance. The `HitInfo` array is then used for subsequent shading calculations or potentially to generate secondary rays for reflections, refractions, and shadows.
